HW5: Lighting

Timothy Mason
CSCI 5229-001B Computer Graphics - University of Colorado Boulder

Time Taken: 14 hours

Expands on the Rockets + Planet scene of HW3 by adding basic lighting

Note that the flickering of the yellow disks at the bottom of each rocket is not a bug.  That
was done intentionally to represent a flickering propulsion flame.  (it is setting the emissions
of the bottom disk material to yellow with a random intensity).
